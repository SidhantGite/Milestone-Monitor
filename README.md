# Milestone Monitor

**Milestone Monitor** is a simple Python script that visually tracks your daily progress throughout the year using a grid of buttons. Each button represents a day, and clicking today's button cycles through progress levels using color codes. Your progress is saved locally in a text file for future use.

## Files Included

- `milestone.py` – Main Python script
- `buttons_data.txt` – Saves daily progress (auto-generated)
- `icon.png` – Optional image/icon for customization

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python milestone.py
