# Milestone-Monitor
Milestone Monitor is a lightweight Python based visual tracker built with Tkinter that lets you track daily progress through a color-coded grid of buttons representing each day of the year. It highlights the current day for easy editing, saves your progress locally, and provides a simple visual overview of your milestones.
